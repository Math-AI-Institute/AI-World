AI-Holistic-View

> **A living map of Artificial Intelligence — connecting ideas, models, and people.**

AI is big — and it keeps growing.  
**AI-Holistic** is a collaborative knowledge base that curates key concepts, models, and research in artificial intelligence.  
We explore everything from classical ideas to the latest agentic systems and generative models.

## 💫 Why AI-Holistic?

Because **AI knowledge is scattered**, fast-changing, and often siloed.  
AI-World aims to make it:
- **Organized** – clear topic maps and interlinked pages  
- **Up-to-date** – reflecting ongoing AI breakthroughs  
- **Open** – a collaborative, community-driven effort  
- **Interactive** – with agentic systems that *use* this knowledge

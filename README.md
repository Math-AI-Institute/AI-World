## 💫 Why AI-World?

Because **AI knowledge is scattered**, fast-changing, and often siloed.  
AI-World aims to make it:
- **Organized** – clear topic maps and interlinked pages  
- **Up-to-date** – reflecting ongoing AI breakthroughs  
- **Open** – a collaborative, community-driven effort  
- **Interactive** – with agentic systems that *use* this knowledge
